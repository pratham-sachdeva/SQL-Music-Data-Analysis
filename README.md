# SQL Database Creation and Analysis Project
Welcome to the SQL Database Creation and Analysis Project! In this repository, you will find the code and documentation for a comprehensive SQL database designed to store music-related information, along with the analysis of the data using various SQL queries.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to create a well-structured relational database to manage music data effectively. The database includes tables for artists, record labels, and songs, each linked through primary keys and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.

## Features and Functionality
1. Database Schema: Designed a robust database schema that reflects the relationships between artists, record labels, and songs. The schema ensures that data is organized logically, making it easy to retrieve relevant information.
2. SQL Queries: The project demonstrates the application of SQL queries to derive valuable insights from the music database. Key SQL queries used include:
List all artists for each record label, sorted by artist name.
Identify record labels with no associated artists.
List the number of songs per artist in descending order.
Determine the artist(s) with the most and least number of recorded songs.
3. Sub-Selects with Temporary Tables: To perform complex data analysis efficiently, we utilized sub-selects along with temporary tables. This approach helped break down complex queries into manageable steps, improving query performance.
4. Joins and Data Integration: The project demonstrates the use of inner and outer joins to combine data from different tables. Joins were crucial to establishing relationships between artists, record labels, and songs, enabling us to draw meaningful conclusions.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Database Creation: The SQL scripts for creating the database and its tables can be found in the "Create_Music_DataBase.sql" file. Execute the script in your preferred SQL server to set up the music database. I have used MySQL, so you would need to tweak it accordingly.
2. SQL Queries: "Data_Analysis_Music_Database.sql" file contains the SQL queries used for data analysis. Feel free to explore and modify these queries to suit your needs.
